JMeter Performance Labs 🚀

A curated collection of advanced JMeter projects, test data, and reports, complete with a sample Node.js application to simulate realistic load testing scenarios.

This repository is designed to demonstrate practical performance engineering skills, moving beyond record-and-playback into professional-grade scripting, frameworks, and integrations.

✨ Highlights

🔄 Correlation → Handle dynamic values (session IDs, tokens)

📑 Parameterization → Data-driven tests using CSVs, UUIDs, timestamps

🔌 Plugins → Enhance JMeter with timers, monitoring, and visualizations

🧩 Modular Framework → Reusable test fragments for scalable scripting

📊 Reports & Analysis → HTML dashboards, listeners, and result files

⚙️ Future → CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) & APM integration

▶️ Getting Started
1. Run the Sample App
cd sample-app/backend
npm install
npm start


👉 App runs on http://localhost:3000

2. Run a JMeter Test (CLI Mode)
jmeter -n -t test-plans/week1_correlation.jmx \
       -l results/week1/results.jtl \
       -e -o results/week1/html_report

📊 Deliverables per Topic

Each learning topic includes:

.jmx scripts in test-plans/

Test data in data/

Results in results/ (JTL + HTML)

Notes in docs/
